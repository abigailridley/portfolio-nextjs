# Personal Tech Portfolio

### Technologies used 
- Built with React & Next.js (App Router & Server Actions)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- React Email & Resend
- Vercel hosting
- Custom Domain


### What I learned from this project
- The intracacies of Typescript and type handling.
  -- I'm aware of the criticisms that Typescript can be overly fussy, but as a junior developer I enjoyed the challenge of the specificity of each variable and props
- Completely fell in love with Tailwind CSS
  -- Cannot see myself going back to file based CSS without a fight. Loved the mobile first ease of responsiveness, enjoyed the flow of work much better.
- My first time working with client side and server side components
  -- Took a while to get used to but any way to modernise and increase efficiency is something I want to implement
- Very interesting in Nextjs capabilities
  -- Have ideas for new projects that use Nextjs baked in data handling and backend functionalities
- As always with a custom domain, I had a lot of fuss and debugging to do but always worth it when my project is live on www.abigailridley.com !
