            Iâ€™m a <span className="font-bold">detail-oriented developer</span>{" "}
            with an enthusiasm for creating{" "}

              functional, accessible, and visually engaging applications
            </span>
            . My journey began in{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">front-end development with React</span>{" "}
            and soon expanded to full-stack work, including an{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">intensive Python course</span> that
            refined my <span className="font-bold">back-end skills</span> and
            gave me hands-on experience as a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Scrum master</span>. Earning a
            distinction there was a proud moment, marking my transition into
            more advanced projects.

            After taking time to travel across the Americas, I&apos;m now
            refreshed and ready to launch tech my career. I&apos;ve broadened my

            <span className="font-bold">cloud computing</span>,{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">DevOps</span>, and a deepened focus on{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">web design and accessibility</span>.
            I&apos;m excited to contribute to a team where I can build on these
            skills, delivering high-impact, user-friendly solutions for a
            diverse audience.
